1964 Debug Console Command Set:
-------------------------------

    COMMAND     WHAT IT DOES
-------------------------------------------------------
          n     do Next instruction
          q     switch processor view back one screen (Views are r4300i, COP0, COP1, COP2)
          w     switch processor view forward one screen
	  z     zip out of loop (still in R&D)
          r     run to address (working on it.)

The Various 1964 Builds
-----------------------

In MSVC, go to Build...Set Active Project.
You will see 3 choices. Please try all 3.

-- The "Release" build is a basic DOS build without a debugger. The emu runs on its own.

-- The "Debug" build is a Win32 console application with debugger. (Use this one for testing and
core development.)

-- The final build option is the Win32 GUI. As of now, the console is enabled in it.
This won't be the case in the future. If you're developing the GUI, you'll be using this build.
