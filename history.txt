1964 Version History
--------------------

Note: Opcodes come in fast, so credit is given on a first-come basis
for accurate opcodes. Let me know if I've overlooked anything with your 
code. :)

This file is comprehensive- including all major and minor
revisions possible.

v0.0.3
     -- New opcodes added: 
	   SLTI, SLTIU, NOR, ADD  (steb)
           ANDI, SUB, SUBU (Themedes)
           LB, LBU, LD (Eudaemon)
     -- ROM is specified as command line parameter (steb)
     -- Ok...MainCPUReg[] & Coprocessors are now _int64. ;) (schibo)
     -- (more to come)

v0.0.2
     -- New opcodes added:
           XORI, ADDU, AND, OR, SLT, SLTU, XOR, MFCO, MTCO    (steb)
     -- Fixed "JumpToNextInstruction()" - no longer needed.   (schibo)
        Fixed another nono of mine: COP0Reg[32] is now of type int32.
        Sorry for the confusion.
     -- Removed COP0.C - Pointless file.

v0.0.1
     -- 1964 released as open source on internet: (schibo)
           Most opcodes decoded; only a handful implemented.
