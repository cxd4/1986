1964 - The N64 Open Source Project 
	 Started by Deku Nut: (schibo@yahoo.com) Joel M.


Introduction:
-------------
This is open source for 1964. It is in the extremely primitive stages right now.
It compiles under MSVC6 with Windows9x/NT.

Coding notes:
-------------

Please study my coding structure before you begin. It's fairly simple.

For now, we will keep the release build ANSI C compliant.

If you make any changes to the debugger, please make sure it does not affect the release build
because the release build will have no signs of the debugger. :) Use #ifdef _DEBUG

You will receive credit for your work in the next release.
