--------- Notes

I have only test on Matrox g200/g400Max and nVidia TnT.

At this time, only 3d cards which support ARGB8888 or ARGB4444 surfaces will work correctly...

if you get a "RDP_CheckTextureFormat()) - missing texture format", your 3d card seem
to not support ARGB8888 or ARGB4444 surface, try to put is as Automatic choice in
configuration else buy an other 3d card :).

Currently I'm focused on try to get this working on my development cards (g200/g400),
later I will add a better 3d card compliantly.
